### **Hello** ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ryan, a Sophomore studying computer science at *Western University*, Ontario!

I'm enrolled in ***Honours Specialization in Computer Science, with a Minor in Game Development***.

Outside of university, I also enjoy playing a variety of instruments (singing, piano, and clarinet) and reading novels. 

Thanks for stopping by!
